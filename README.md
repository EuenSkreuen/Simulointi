# Simulointi
TIES481-20

## main.py
This is the thing you want to run. If you want to change simulation parameters,
change main.py

## simulation.py
Contains the code for the hospital simulation. Returns different information 
regarding the simulation.

If you need to change the preparation, surgery or recovery times, simulation.py 
has those parameters.

## stats.py
Contains the code for some statistics related functions

## TODO

- priorities
- monitoring - does SimPy have it's own monitoring-unit we could use?
- maybe do more comments to the code

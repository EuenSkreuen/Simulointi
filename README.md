# Simulation
Simulation workshop of course TIES481-20 / University of Jyväskylä. This is a 
hospital simulation, in which there are limited number of preparation rooms, 
operation rooms and recovery rooms. New patient arrives in every 10 minutes. 

## main.py
This is the thing you want to run. If you want to change simulation parameters,
change main.py

## simulation.py
Contains the code for the hospital simulation. Returns different information 
regarding the simulation.

If you need to change the preparation, surgery or recovery times, simulation.py 
has those parameters.

## stats.py
Contains the code for some statistics related functions

## TODO

- priorities
- monitoring - does SimPy have it's own monitoring-unit we could use?
- maybe write more comments inside the code
